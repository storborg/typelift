Typelift - Extract Typekit Fonts
================================

Hokay, so you're sitting there drinking your coffee. Your boss comes over and
he's like "I need you to mock up a new page, stat!" So then you whip open
Photoshop and you realize you're dead on the water because your Photoshop
install doesn't seem to have access to this funky new font that random web
jockey put on your website.

Enter Typelift:

Installation
============

Install with pip::

    $ pip install typelift


Usage
=====

Just supply URLs where Typekit fonts are used:

    $ typelift http://www.example.com

Then you'll find .otf files in your local directory.
